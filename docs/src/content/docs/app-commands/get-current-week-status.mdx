description: Reference for the /get_current_week_status bot command for administrators.

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Provides administrators with a quick overview of the bot's currently configured season and week, and lists which teams have submitted decks for those settings.

## Usage

```
/get_current_week_status
```

This command is used without any arguments in a server channel.

## Permissions

This command can only be used by users with a role listed in the `ADMIN_ROLES` environment variable.

## Details

Upon using this command, the bot will report:

- The current season (as set by `/set_season`).
- The current week (as set by `/set_week`).
- A list of teams that have successfully submitted decks for the current season and week.
- A list of teams that have not yet submitted decks for the current season and week (inferred from the `TEAM_ROLES` configuration and recorded submissions).

This command is useful for administrators to quickly check the progress of submissions for the ongoing week.

<Aside>
  You can change the current season and week using the `/set_season` and
  `/set_week` commands to view the submission status for past weeks. However,
  **always ensure that deck submissions are disabled (`/enable_deck_submissions
  False`) before changing the season or week to view historical data** to
  prevent team captains from accidentally submitting decks to an incorrect
  season or week.
