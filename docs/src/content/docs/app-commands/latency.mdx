description: Reference for the /latency bot command.
---

Displays the bot's current latency (ping) to the Discord API in milliseconds. This command is primarily useful for checking the bot's responsiveness.

## Usage

```
/latency
```

This command is used without any arguments in a server channel.

## Availability

This command is only available when the bot's `ENVIORNMENT` is set to `local` in the `.env` file. If the bot is running in `production` mode, this command will not be accessible.

## Permissions

This command can be used by **anyone** in a server where the bot is present when running in `local` environment.

## Details

Upon using this command, the bot will calculate the time it takes to receive a response from the Discord API and report that time in milliseconds. This gives an indication of the bot's current connection speed and responsiveness.
