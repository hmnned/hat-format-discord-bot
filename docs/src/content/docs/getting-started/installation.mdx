This section guides you through the process of installing the Yu-Gi-Oh! War League Deck Submission Bot for self-hosting using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Docker:** You will need either [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (for Windows or macOS) or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (for Linux).
- **Docker Compose:** This is typically installed alongside Docker Desktop or can be installed separately for Docker Engine ([installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)).
- **Git:** For cloning the bot's repository ([installation guide](https://git-scm.com/downloads)).
- **A Discord Account:** To create and manage your bot application.

## Cloning the Repository

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can clone the bot's repository to your local machine.

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you want to store the bot's code.
3.  Run the following command:

    <Code
      code="git clone https://github.com/nedhmn/ygo-war-league-discord-bot"
      lang="bash"
    />

4.  Navigate into the cloned directory:

    <Code code="cd your-repository-name" lang="bash" />

You have now successfully downloaded the bot's code. The next step is to configure the bot and set up your Discord application.
